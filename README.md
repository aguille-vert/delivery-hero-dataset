# Delivery Hero Recommendation Dataset

The dataset was released with the paper "Delivery Hero Recommendation Dataset: A Novel Dataset for Benchmarking Recommendation Algorithms" at [RecSys23](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys23/).  

This repository includes a series of notebooks exploring various aspects of the dataset with a view to develop novel approaches to a food delivery recommender system. 

Our particular interest is application of LLM to enhance food delivery recommender systems.

It's a work in progress.

The first notebook [00_delivery_hero_eda.ipynb](https://github.com/aguille-vert/delivery-hero-dataset/blob/main/notebooks/00_delivery_hero_eda.ipynb) includes analysis of the structure of the dataset.
